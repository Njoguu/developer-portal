    Since APIs.io, and APIs are a very business centered concept, LinkedIn is our social platform of choice. Visit LinkedIn to stay tuned with updates and engage with us as we add more APIs to the platform and refine how the API search algorithm works.

    We are trying to steer most ongoing discussions to the GitHub discussions forum because these conversations can live on and onboard new users over time. Feel free to start any new discussion--if it is about discovering APIs we want to talking about it here.
